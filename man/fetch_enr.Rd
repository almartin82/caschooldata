\title{Fetch California enrollment data}
\usage{
fetch_enr(end_year, tidy = TRUE, use_cache = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year. Year is the end of the academic year - e.g., 2024
for the 2023-24 school year. Supports 1982-2025:
\itemize{
\item 2024-2025: Modern Census Day files with full demographic breakdowns
\item 2008-2023: Historical files with race/gender data and entity names
\item 1994-2007: Historical files with race/gender data (no entity names)
\item 1982-1993: Historical files with letter-based race codes
}}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE (default), returns data in long (tidy) format with grade
and subgroup columns. If FALSE, returns wide format with grade columns.}

\item{use_cache}{If TRUE (default), uses locally cached data when available.
Set to FALSE to force re-download from CDE.}
}
\value{
A tibble with enrollment data. In tidy format, includes columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{end_year}: School year end (integer)
\item \code{district_id}: 5-digit district identifier (formerly district_code)
\item \code{campus_id}: 7-digit campus identifier (formerly school_code, NA for district rows)
\item \code{district_name}: District name
\item \code{campus_name}: Campus name (formerly school_name, NA for district rows)
\item \code{type}: Aggregation level ("State", "County", "District", or "Campus")
\item \code{grade_level}: Grade (TK, K, 01-12, TOTAL, K8, HS, or K12). Note: TK is NA for 1982-2023.
\item \code{subgroup}: Demographic subgroup (total, hispanic, white, asian, black, etc.)
\item \code{n_students}: Enrollment count
\item \code{pct}: Percentage of total enrollment (0-1 scale)
}
}
\description{
Downloads and processes enrollment data from the California Department of
Education DataQuest data files. Data is based on Census Day enrollment
(first Wednesday in October).
}
\details{
Historical data differs from modern (2024+) data in several ways:
\itemize{
\item Transitional Kindergarten (TK) data is not available (grade_tk is NA)
\item Charter status is not available (charter_status is "All")
\item District and county aggregates are computed from school-level data
\item Student group categories (SG_*) are not available
\item For 1994-2007: Entity names are not available (use CDS code to look up)
\item For 1982-1993: Race categories use different coding (mapped to modern codes)
}
}
